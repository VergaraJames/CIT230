            <h2>Hick’s Law</h2>

            <p>Hick’s Law says that with every additional choice increases the time required to take a decision.<br> You’ve experienced this countless times at restaurants. Menus with huge options make it difficult to choose your dinner. If it offered two
                options, making a decision would take much less time. This is similar to the Paradox of Choice—the more choices you give, the easier it is to choose nothing. Both principles come into play with web design.

            <p> The more options a user has on your website, the more difficult it is to use (if it’s used at all). We need to eliminate choices. To make a better web design, focus on eliminating distracting options throughout the design process.
                <br> In an era of infinite choice, people need better filters! If you sell a huge number of products, add better filters for easier decision-making. Wine Library sells a huge amount of wine.

            <h2>Fitt’s Law</h2>

            <p>Fitt’s law stipulates that the time required to move to a target area (e.g. click a button) is a function of the distance to the target and the size of the target. In other words, the bigger an object and the closer it is, the easier it is
                to use. On the mobile phone app, they also place the play button in an easy-to-tap location. Bigger isn’t always better. A button that takes up half the screen isn’t a good idea, and we don’t need a mathematical study to tell us. Even
                so, Fitt’s Law is a binary logarithm. This means that the predicted results of the usability of an object run along a curve, not a straight line. A tiny button is much easier to click when given a 20% size increase, whereas a very large
                object, given the same 20% boost in size, won’t deliver the same benefits in usability. This is similar to the rule of target size. The size of a button should be proportional to its expected frequency of use. You can use mouse tracking
                to see which buttons people use the most, then make popular buttons bigger (easier to hit).

            <h2>Occam’s Razor</h2>
            <p>When given several competing hypothesis, Occam’s razor urges you to choose the one that makes the fewest assumptions and, thereby, offers the simplest explanation. To put it in the context of web design, Occam’s Razor argues that the simplest
                solution is usually best. In a post about their Angelpad experience, Pipedrive’s team writes:
            </p>
            <p class="quote"> The Angelpad team and mentors challenged us in many ways. “You have too many things on your home page” was something we didn’t agree with at first, but we’re happy to test. And it turned out we had been wrong indeed. We removed 80% of the
                content, and left one sign-up button and one Learn More link on the home page. Conversion to sign up increased by 300%.

            <p> It’s not just about the looks, but also about how it works. Some companies—like 37Signals—have turned “simple” into a business model. Here’s a quote from the book Rework, written by founders Jason Fried:
            </p>
            <p class="quote"> Lots of people hate us because our products do less than the competition. They’re insulted when we refuse to include their pet feature. But we’re just as proud of what our products don’t do as we are of what they do. We design them to be simple
                because we believe most software is too complex: too many features, too many buttons, too much confusion.
            </p>Simple, minimalist design does not guarantee that the design will work. But, in my experience, simple is always better than the opposite—and, hence, we should strive to simplify our web designs.
