                    <p>Alignment is a design tool and refers to how elements are placed on a page. Form a visual appeal. Promotional texts, decorative or smaller texts, the other types are used strategically. Typically, the alignment applies to two specific
                        design elements: typography and images. Graphic designers try to create a balance between the two so that both images and text are visually attractive and have a perfect connection. Through good use of alignment, a composition
                        will appear orderly, clean and readable for an audience.
